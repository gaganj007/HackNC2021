Project Submission for HackNC2021

This project is a seadling whose purpose is to help the physically challenged, especially blind, individual to learn how to type. The goal is to play the sound of the key the type out load, so they can associate the sound to the key they have pressed.

This project exculsively uses Java for coding, .wav files for audio, and YouTube video for resources. Attached below is the link to the video that was used in development of the project.
